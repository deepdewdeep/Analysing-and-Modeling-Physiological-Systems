# Analysing and Modeling Physiological Systems
This was a individual project done by me,along with the module I studied in the semester 3 under name Modeling and Analysis of Physiological Systems.

## Huxley-Hodgkin model
We delve into the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, essential for understanding nerve cell action potentials. Exploring properties like threshold behavior, refractoriness,etc., we employ MATLAB for simulation. Our aim is to provide a nuanced understanding of neuronal dynamics, crucial for research in neurobiology and related fields
