Welcome to the simulation focused on exploring the properties of the renowned Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This simulation delves into key aspects of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, investigating their behavior and characteristics. Specifically, we will explore the following four features that are observed physiologically:

### Features Explored:

 1. Threshold
 2. Refractoriness - Absolute and Relative
 3. Repetitive Activity
 4. Temperature Dependence

## Instructions to Setup
1.Download the all files in one directory
2.Run the MATLAB Livescript.
