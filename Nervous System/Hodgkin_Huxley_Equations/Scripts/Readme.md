Welcome to the simulation focused on exploring the properties of the renowned Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This simulation delves into key aspects of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, investigating their behavior and characteristics. Specifically, we will explore the following four features that are observed physiologically:

## Features Explored:

### 1. Threshold
We examine the threshold potential, the membrane voltage at which an action potential is initiated. Understanding this critical point is fundamental to grasping neuronal excitability.

### 2. Refractoriness - Absolute and Relative
Explore the concepts of absolute and relative refractoriness, crucial intervals during which a neuron cannot generate another action potential. This phenomenon plays a vital role in the neuron's firing patterns.

### 3. Repetitive Activity
Dive into the repetitive activity of neurons, understanding how they sustain a series of action potentials over time. This feature sheds light on the neuron's ability to convey information continuously.

### 4. Temperature Dependence
Investigate the impact of temperature on the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. Temperature profoundly influences the kinetics of ion channels, shaping the behavior of action potentials under varying thermal conditions.
