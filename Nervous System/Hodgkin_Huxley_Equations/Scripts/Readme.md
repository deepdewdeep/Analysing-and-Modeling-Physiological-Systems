Welcome to the simulation focused on exploring the properties of the renowned Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This simulation delves into key aspects of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, investigating their behavior and characteristics. Specifically, we will explore the following four features that are observed physiologically:

### Features Explored:

 1. Threshold
 2. Refractoriness - Absolute and Relative
 3. Repetitive Activity
 4. Temperature Dependence

## Overview
The Hodgkin-Huxley equations provide a fundamental understanding of how neurons generate and propagate action potentials. This simulation will enable to observe and analyze these properties, shedding light on how neurons respond to electrical stimulation.

## Instructions to Setup
1. Download the all files in one directory
2. Run the MATLAB Livescript.

## Simulation Steps
### 1. Threshold
 - Explore the concept of threshold by applying sub-threshold and supra-threshold current pulses.
 - Observe the behavior of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations in response to different current amplitudes.
### 2. Refractoriness
 - Investigate absolute and relative refractory periods.
 - Study the relationship between consecutive action potentials and stimulus amplitudes.
### 3. Repetitive Activity
 - Examine repetitive activity by eliciting multiple action potentials with long duration supra-threshold currents.
 - Determine the threshold for repetitive activity as a function of the inter-stimulus interval.
### 4. Temperature Dependence
 - Observe the effects of different temperatures on the duration and amplitude of action potentials.
 - Analyze how temperature influences various features of the action potential.
